;; Exercise 1.16: Design a procedure that evolves an iterative 
;; exponentiation process that uses successive squaring
;; and uses a logarithmic number of steps, as does fast-expt.
;; (Hint: Using the observation that (b^(n/2))^2 = (b^2)^(n/2), keep,
;; along with the exponent n and the base b, an additional
;; state variable a, and define the state transformation in such
;; a way that the product ab^n is unchanged from state to state.
;; At the beginning of the process a is taken to be 1, and the
;; answer is given by the value of a at the end of the process.
;; In general, the technique of defining an invariant quantity
;; that remains unchanged from state to state is a powerful
;; way to think about the design of iterative algorithms.)

;; Exercise 1.17: The exponentiation algorithms in this section are based on 
;; performing exponentiation by means of
;; repeated multiplication. In a similar way, one can perform
;; integer multiplication by means of repeated addition. ÓÅâe
;; following multiplication procedure (in which it is assumed
;; that our language can only add, not multiply) is analogous
;; to the expt procedure:
;; (define (* a b)
;; (if (= b 0)
;; 0
;; (+ a (* a (- b 1)))))
;; This algorithm takes a number of steps that is linear in b.
;; Now suppose we include, together with addition, operations double, 
;; which doubles an integer, and halve, which
;; divides an (even) integer by 2. 
;; Using these, design a multiplication procedure analogous to 
;; fast-expt that uses a
;; logarithmic number of steps.
