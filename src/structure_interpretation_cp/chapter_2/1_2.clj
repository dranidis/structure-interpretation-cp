;; Exercise 2.2: Consider the problem of representing line
;; segments in a plane. Each segment is represented as a pair
;; of points: a starting point and an ending point. Define a
;; constructor make-segment and selectors start-segment and
;; end-segment that define the representation of segments in
;; terms of points. Furthermore, a point can be represented
;; as a pair of numbers: the x coordinate and the y coordinate. 
;; Accordingly, specify a constructor make-point and
;; selectors x-point and y-point that define this representation. 
;; Finally, using your selectors and constructors, define a
;; procedure midpoint-segment that takes a line segment as
;; argument and returns its midpoint (the point whose coordinates 
;; are the average of the coordinates of the endpoints).
;; To try your procedures, youâ€™ll need a way to print points:
;; (define (print-point p)
;; (newline)
;; (display "(")
;; (display (x-point p))
;; (display ",")
;; 1(display (y-point p))
;; (display ")"))

;; Exercise 2.3: Implement a representation for rectangles in
;; a plane. (Hint: You may want to make use of Exercise 2.2.) In
;; terms of your constructors and selectors, create procedures
;; that compute the perimeter and the area of a given rectangle. 
;; Now implement a different representation for rectangles. 
;; Can you design your system with suitable abstraction
;; barriers, so that the same perimeter and area procedures
;; will work using either representation?
